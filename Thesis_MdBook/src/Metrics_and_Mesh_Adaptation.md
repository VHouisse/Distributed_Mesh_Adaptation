# Metrics and Mesh Adaptation

In this section, we will cover the fundamental concepts of mesh adaptation, with a particular focus on anisotropic mesh adaptation. We will detail the notion of metrics, their derived properties, and their role in the adaptation process. Finally, we will present the various commonly used remeshing operations
